# Eduhunt
It is an educational website made using html css js and mogodb in which you can enroll and study the course of your choice pretty much like udemy.
Basically it is a technical platform where anyone can get enrolled in a technical course like database design , system design etc. In today's world where there is a
flood of internet resources which is unstructured and sophusticated many times makes it difficult for many people who want to learn but don't have money. My site will
provide them proper structured course at 0 or minimal cost. How? we know a lot person who are ready to volunteer and teach for free, just like prayas club in our college.
The technology used in this website are given below-
1.html
2.css
3.javascript
4.mongodb
5.I'm going to integrate react in near future.
The screenshots of the site are hereby attached for user's reference.
